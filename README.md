# Chromebook scripts for quick python setup

Do you want to set up your Chromebook for Python development faster after a powerwash?

Are you new to Python and want to do some development on your Chromebook?

... if so then these scripts may be useful timesavers.

## A warning

You use these scripts at your own risk. They are tested on my Google Pixelbook and work nice and quickly after a clean powerwash (that wipes the Chromebook). They may or may not work on all Chromebooks.

## Scripts

### Installing latest Python 3 on the Chromebook

This is quite a time-consuming task. My chromebook comes with Python 3.5 as standard. This is now getting a bit out of date.

### Starting a new Python project and creating a Virtual Environment

A single script to create a new virtual environment, and project folder for a new Python project

```bash
    ./python-project.sh
```

### Jupyter Notebook projects

Chromebooks work pretty well for Jupyter projects. This short script sets up a new project folder

### Post-Powerwash reinstall

Reinstalling Python and other development tools after a Powerwash takes some time. These scripts make this very quick on my machine.

** Warning - some of these installations are at a more basic level so it is possible that they will not work on all Chromebooks. This has been tested on a Google Pixelbook**
