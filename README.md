# Chromebook scripts for quick python setup

Do you want to set up your Chromebook for Python development faster after a powerwash?

Are you new to Python and want to do some development on your Chromebook?

... if so then these scripts may be useful timesavers.

## A warning

You use these scripts at your own risk. They are tested on my Google Pixelbook and work nice and quickly after a clean powerwash (that wipes the Chromebook). They may or may not work on all Chromebooks.

## Scripts

### Installing latest Python 3 on the Chromebook

This is quite a time-consuming task. My chromebook comes with Python 3.5 as standard. This is now getting a bit out of date.

## Finally

If you find this useful, then please give it a star (click on the Github star at the top right of the screen) so that others find this repo more easily.

If you are a pro and find some bugs for certain Chromebooks in the scripts, or want to create other useful scripts, please do raise an issue or create a pull request.
